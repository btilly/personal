# Theory of Mind-Body Connections

Modern science has confirmed,  
what the ancient sages knew.  
Mind-body connections are real.

They exist in every part of the body.  
They are found in everything we do.  
You can find them by observation.

Every connection goes both ways.  
So if being happy makes you smile,  
then smiling must make you happy.

Why do we work in this bizarre way?  
It's because we're a pile of hacks built on,  
"If it works, don't change it."

Our minds talk to themselves  
through our bodies.  
This is literally true.

When paraplegics lose their legs,  
they lose mind-body connections.  
Which reduces emotional reactions. (\*)

Here is how we can choose to use this.  
Body awareness brings mind awareness.  
Body control brings control over our minds.

Others see and hear the result.  
And then mirror us.  
Causing them to feel the same.

What do you want  
your audience to feel?  
Feel it yourself first.

Show, don't tell!  
It takes very few words,  
to deliver a feeling.

You can deliver any emotion.  
Take a quick breath in.  
Now try to sound excited!

There are many connections.  
Each takes practice to use.  
But you can start anywhere.

In this, as with all things,  
Vilfredo Pareto was right.  
The biggest wins come quickly.

But there is always more to learn.  
And with it, more to master.  
How far you go is up to you.

This series gives a few examples.  
With specific application to performance.  
But the principle is far more general.

Discover connections through observation.  
Master usage through practice.  
You can apply this in all areas of life.
