# The Power of a Comma

(Picture of a person with a closed mouth)

A comma is a pause,  
that separates a sentence, 
into easily understood pieces.

Standing silent,  
is an act of control,  
that may feel uncomfortable.

We avoid that discomfort  
with filler words,  
or by speaking quickly.

This communicates nervousness, 
to ourselves and others.  
Then control feels impossible.

But put in a comma,  
stand silent on the stage,  
you will feel in control again.

When you feel in control,  
you regain your control,  
improving your presentation.

# Drop Your Shoulders

(Picture of someone with shoulders dropping)

Do your shoulders hold tension?
This makes our shoulders rise.  
It feels normal.

As you breath out,  
let your shoulders drop.  
How do your shoulders feel"

Your shoulders will rise again.  
That is OK,  
Just let them drop again.
