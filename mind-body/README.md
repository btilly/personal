# Mind-Body For Presentations

This repository lists ideas for worksheets that talk about how to use
mind-body connections when presenting.

A lot of it is based on lessons that I learned in choir, from Eileen Cooper
in the 1980s, at Esquimalt Secondary. I didn't learn the full value of these
early lessons until many years later.

Here are some of the ideas that I am starting with:

1. [What is in a smile?](./smiling.md)
2. [With One Breath](./breath.md)
3. [The Power of a Comma / Drop Your Shoulders](./comma-drop.md)
4. [Improve Your Posture](./posture.md)
5. [Theory of Mind-Body Connections](./theory.md)

Note that the triplets sort of happened, then I kept them as a good idea.
It allows me to present something that can be read through, which can be
revisited over and over again. On a slow re-read, each triplet presents a
discrete idea. That can be meditated on at length.

Here is my idea for a copyright notice:

(Eileen Cooper was my high school choir teacher. She taught me most of
these lessons. I didn't appreciate the lessons fully until I tried using
them at Toastmasters.)
