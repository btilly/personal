# Mind-Body For Presentations

This repository lists ideas for worksheets that talk about how to use
mind-body connections when presenting.

A lot of it is based on lessons that I learned in choir, from Eileen Cooper
in the 1980s, at Esquimalt Secondary. I didn't learn the full value of these
early lessons until many years later.

Here are some of the ideas that I am starting with:

1. [What is in a smile?](./smiling.md)
2. [With One Breath](./breath.md)
3. [The Power of a Comma / Drop Your Shoulders](./comma-drop.md)
