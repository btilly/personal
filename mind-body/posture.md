# Improve Your Posture

When under assault,  
we curl into a ball.  
Kind of like turtles.

Good posture does the opposite.  
Stand up straight,  
and open our vulnerable fronts.

Poor posture is like turtling.  
We hunch over, with head down.  
Our hands are tight in front.

Posture creates mind-body connections.  
Good posture is confident.  
Bad posture is defensive.

Either can come first.  
Stress creates poor posture.  
So do modern conveniences.  

We slouch as we use  
phones, computers, and TVs,  
with our hands in front.

We naturally remain slouched.  
Making us more defensive.  
Which adds to our stress.

It is hard to fix posture.  
The body holds its form.  
Research fascia for more.

But even a small effort  
makes a huge difference!  
Try this exercise:

Stand up fairly straight.
Shoulders go forward,  
up, back (while up), down.

Your chest should lock open.  
Now pull up on some hair  
at the back of your head.

Straighten your back.  
Lengthen your neck.  
Drop your chin.

Let your hands drop.  
Open palms to the front.  
Smile.

This is open and confident.  
You will feel it.  
Your audience will respond.
