# With One Breath

What can one breath do?  
Try the following exercise,  
Then decide for yourself.

(Insert diagram here.)

Indicate your breath with your hands.  
Hands at hips for breath out.  
Hands at ribs for breath in.

Breathe out.  
Then follow the diagram.
Counting at an even pace.

How do you feel?  
After just one breath,  
in the rhythm of a contented sigh.

This is a 1-2-3 breath.  
Many breathing techniques,  
create strong mind-body connections.

Your hands just helped you visualize.  
Your counting was to get the rhythm.  
The breath was what mattered.

Standing on stage,  
before you open your mouth,  
take a 1-2-3 breath.

If you're overwhelmed by anxiety,  
pause and take a 1-2-3 breath.  
You can do it quite quickly.

This centering breath makes you calm.  
Which makes your presentation easier to give,  
and makes you appear more confident.

This is how one breath,  
that you can do at any time,  
can help your presentation.

-----

The diagram would be someone standing with hands at stomach level. A line
next to them rises on a diagonal from hip to bottom of the ribs over a
count of 2, stays high for a count of 4, and then goes back over a count of
6. Leading to breathing in over one period, holding it for twice as long,
and breathing out over three times as long. (Hence, 1-2-3 breath.)
