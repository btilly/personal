# With One Breath

What can one breath do?  
Try the following exercise,  
Then decide for yourself.

(Insert diagram here.)

Indicate your breath with your hands.  
Hands at hips for breath out.  
Hands at ribs for breath in.

Breathe out.  
Then follow the diagram.  
Counting at an even pace.

How do you feel?  
After just one breath,  
in the rhythm of a contented sigh.

Your hands helped you visualize.  
Your counting gave the rhythm.  
The breath alone mattered.

This is a 1-2-3 breath.  
Many breathing techniques,  
create strong mind-body connections.

Breath techniques appear,  
in yoga, meditation, therapy...  
This one is fast and convenient.

Standing on stage,  
before you open your mouth,  
take a 1-2-3 breath.

If you're overwhelmed by anxiety,  
pause for a 1-2-3 breath.  
You can do this quite quickly.

Take this centering breath.  
It makes you calm on stage.  
You will appear more confident.

This is what you can do  
with a single breath,  
to make speaking easier.

-----

The diagram would be someone standing with hands at stomach level. A line
next to them rises on a diagonal from hip to bottom of the ribs over a
count of 2, stays high for a count of 4, and then goes back over a count of
6. Leading to breathing in over one period, holding it for twice as long,
and breathing out over three times as long. (Hence, 1-2-3 breath.)
