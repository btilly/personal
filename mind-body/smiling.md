# What Smiling Does

We smile when we are happy.  
Smiling also makes us happy.  
Mind-body connections go both ways.

When you choose to smile,  
everything becomes better.  
For you and others.

(Insert flow diagram here.)


Study this diagram carefully.  
Every connection is real!  
They all work together.

When we pay attention,  
we register what others feel.  
Then feel it ourselves.

We enjoy being happy.  
So we actively enjoy  
paying attention to happy people.

Did you know that McDonalds  
has their employees smile  
when they take your order?

Customers hear the smile,  
even when they can't see it!  
And it makes ordering nicer.

You cannot always smile.  
Good stories often need  
other emotions.

But bring your audience back  
to a happier place!  
Make smiling your default!

    2. Smiles (double arrow back to 1)
    3. Sounds happy (arrow from 1)
3. Audience...
    1. Smiles (arrow to 2.1. double arrow to 4)
    2. Sees happy (arrow from 2.2, arrow to 4)
    3. Hears happy (arrow from 2.3, arrow to 4)
