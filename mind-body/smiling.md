# What Smiling Does

We smile when we are happy.
Did you know that smiling makes us happy?
What happens when you choose to smile?

(Insert flow diagram here.)

Smiling is a choice.
It makes the meeting better for everyone,
and especially for you!

Most of us are not used to smiling.
It becomes comfortable with practice.
With practice, it becomes your resting face

If you can get your audience to smile,
they will enjoy your presentation more.
Your smile helps that happen.

You always have the choice.
Even if you didn't do it before.
Will you choose to smile?

  3. Sounds happy (arrow from 1)
