# What Smiling Does

We smile when we are happy.  
Smiling also makes us happy.  
Mind-body connections go both ways.

When you choose to smile,  
everything becomes better.  
For you and others.

(Insert flow diagram here.)


Study this diagram carefully.  
Every connection is real!  
They all work together.

When we pay attention,  
we register what others feel.  
Then often feel it ourselves.

What do you want  
your audience to feel?  
You should feel it first.

Show, don't tell!  
It takes less than we think,  
to deliver a feeling.

And when that feeling is good,  
people want to pay attention!  
Happiness holds your audience!

Stories often need  
other emotions it's true.  
Drama requires that tension.

But bring your audience back  
to a happier place!  
Make your default a smile!
