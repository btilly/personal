# A Troubled Graduation
- After my son’s high school graduation
- I started crying after mentioning public school
- Remembering a fight caused a realization
- Which triggered my mental breakdown

# Key Questions (1)
- Why did I have a mental breakdown?
- What was that realization?
- What are the implications?
- *We will return to these questions.*

# Classroom Discipline is Hard
- Keeping children in line is hard
- Harder if children are uninterested
- Harder in groups
- Very few can do what teachers do

# Operant Conditioning
- Reward the behaviors you want
- Punish the behaviors you don’t
- Any reward/punishment works
- Carrots and ice cream for horses
- Ice cream and beatings for children

# Key Questions (2.a)
- Why did I have a mental breakdown? (5%)
  - High school graduation?
  - Mother was a school teacher?
  - Punishments?

# Key Questions (2.b)
- What was that realization? (2%)
  - Something about punishments?
  - Something about mother?
- What are the implications? (1%)
  - Children get punished in school?

# Strictly Verbal
- Teachers today use words
- Reward with praise
- Punish with verbal reprimands
- Use hidden verbal attacks

# What is a Hidden Verbal Attack?
- An attack neither attacker nor victim remembers
- For the attacker, a phrase they don’t think about
- For the victim:
  - Brings up a painful idea, quickly suppressed
  - The pain remains
- Suppressing the idea means forgetting the attack
- *If you loved me, you'd be doing the dishes already.*

# The Theory of Hidden Verbal Attacks
- Read *The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense* by Suzette Elgin
- Reveal the attack with a curiosity question
  - *If you loved me, you'd be doing the dishes already.*
  - *For how long have you thought that I might not love you?*
- Attackers won’t want to keep saying it
- This shows that they were not aware!

# Key Questions (3.a)

# Classroom Discipline is Good

- Lots of praise
- The environment promotes learning
- They get an education

# But NOT For All Children
- Especially hard hit are those with:
  - Emotional problems
  - Intelligent
  - Neurodivergent (ADHD or autistic)
- Let’s look at each of these

# Children With Emotional Problems
- Act out more
- Problems are targets for attacks
- Teachers are unaware
- Makes their problems worse

# Intelligent Children
- Are a problem for teachers:
  - Ask inconvenient questions
  - Blurt out answers
- Intelligence suppressed
- Contributes to Gifted-At-Risk

# Neurodivergent Children\n(ADHD and Autism)
- Lack executive control
- Forget rules in the moment
- Constantly reprimanded
- Son received over 20x average!
- School becomes a nightmare

  - Her denials were the worst

  - Driven by cognitive dissonance
- Angry confrontations failed
- She died, unforgiven

# My Son’s Situation
- All three groups again
  - Emotional problems - bad divorce
  - Intelligent - high IQ
  - Neurodivergent - ADHD
    - Can’t handle side-effects of meds
- School was a nightmare
- My problems kept me from being there for him

  - He needed love and care
  - Poor teacher
- We were committed on this

# A Bizarre Event
- Grade 5 report card was bad
- Teacher called
  - Wanted me to get angry
  - So he'd pay more attention
  - Opposite of what I thought
- Yet, I did it

# My Then-Girlfriend’s Reaction
- She was furious
- Accused me of intellectual dishonesty
- I stonewalled
- The fight didn’t end, it simmered

# My Realization
- The teacher used a hidden verbal attack
- It overwhelmed me
  - Will give example when I publish
  - Based on pain of bad divorce
- Reminded me of my mother
- My son was receiving the same

# My Subconscious Intervenes
- I couldn’t handle it
- My subconscious suppressed it
- Until my son left school
- That’s why graduation was the trigger

# Key Questions (6.a)
- Why did I have a mental breakdown? (100%)
  - Unprocessed trauma from hidden verbal attacks:
    - School, mother, son
  - Failure as father
  - Worse than I imagined
  - Graduation connected it all

# Key Questions (6.b)
- What was that realization? (100%)
  - A hidden verbal attack can override my will
  - This is what my mother did
  - This is what my son went through
  - If I can’t handle it, he can’t either
  - I can't handle knowing this

# Key Questions (6.c)

  - Classroom discipline is good for most
  - Worse for some:
    - Emotional problems, intelligent, neurodivergent
  - Contributes to major problems
  - Severely traumatic if you have all three
  - **Teachers don’t know that they do this**

# My Son in Public School
- On IEP
- Many expensive interventions
- None helped
- Because of those verbal attacks

# An Effective Therapy
- Grade 7: UCI Child Development School (The Craig School)
- Effective for ADHD and Autism
  - Only therapy that I’ve heard of which works
- Cheaper than IEP
- Conditions to: *Every should must come reinforced by a want*
- Maximizes executive control

# An Effective Learning Environment
- Pacific Academy high school
  - *The freedom to be me.*
- Offered rigorous academics, fast pace, and individual flexibility
- Pace kept son’s attention
- Entered behind, exited with AP college credit
- Cost similar to public school

# Public Schools Can’t Do This
- Federal law prevents it
- IDEA places disabled kids in classrooms
- On expensive IEPs
- Facing those hidden verbal attacks

# Conclusion
- Classroom discipline is necessary
- But some kids pay a high price
  - Emotional problems, intelligent, neurodivergent
- They should be removed from the classroom
- This requires changing federal law
- **Only way to reduce the cost of classroom discipline**
